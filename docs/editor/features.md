# Extra Features

It would be impossible to pre-install and configuring every possible package or feature,
while maintain a flexible *workspace* footprint.
Therefore, we developed an *opt-in* method to seamlessly install and configure additional
features at the user's discretion.

Behind the scenes, we are simply running an *Ansible playbook* in order to install the
desired feature.

## Installing Features

We provide two methods for installing additional features in the *workspace*.
You can choose the method that best fits your needs.

### Install at Boot

Upon workspace startup, we evaluate the value of the `WS_EXTRA_FEATURES` environment
variable in order to automate the installation of additional *features*.

```sh{2}
docker run \
  -e WS_EXTRA_FEATURES="dotnet jupyter" \
  ghcr.io/kloudkit/workspace:latest
```

### Manual Installation

Manual installing features is as easy as running a simple command line prompt.

```sh
# Help information
ws feature install -h

# Example: installing PHP
ws feature install php
```

As mentioned above, all features are backed by Ansible playbooks.
All playbooks are stored in the `/features` root directory.

The directory location can be overridden using the `--root` flag when installing.
The example below will look for a *playbook* at `/alternate/php.yaml`:

```sh
ws feature install php --root /alternate
```

## Custom Features

You can create your own custom *playbook* by using the starter template below.
Make sure not to change the `hosts: workspace`, as it is defined to target the current
workspace session.

::: code-group

```yaml [playbook]
# /alternate/custom.yaml
- name: Install a custom feature
  gather_facts: false
  hosts: workspace

  tasks:
    - name: Just saying hello
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: Hello world! ðŸ‘‹
```

```sh [install]
ws feature install custom --root /alternate
```
