# Port Forwarding

When developing within a *workspace* *(container)*, ports exposed by the running instance
are not accessible externally by default, due to Docker's network isolation settings,
which are implemented for security reasons.

To enable external connections, specific network configurations or port forwarding must
be set up.

Ports published within the *workspace* are automatically detected and accessible through
an internal proxy.
A notification will appear in the bottom-right corner of the workspace, providing quick
access to the published service.

The following sections outline the available methods for enabling access to services
running inside the *workspace* instance.

## Access Methods

### Subpath Access *(enabled by default)*

All published ports in the *workspace* are accessible through a subpath format as
`/proxy/<port>/`.

For example, if your *workspace* is deployed at `127.0.0.1` and you run the `pyserver`
command in the terminal *(which deploys a file index server on port `8000`)*, you can
access the server at `127.0.0.1/proxy/8000`.

### Subdomain Access

::: warning
When using a reverse proxy, ensure that it is correctly configured to forward the host
header.
This is crucial for the service access configuration to function properly.
:::

For subdomain access, you must configure a *DNS* entry for each port you want to access.
Alternatively, you can set up a wildcard DNS entry *(`*.<domain>`)* to automatically
manage proxying across all ports.

::: info
If adding DNS entries is not possible, refer to the [documentation below](#local-dns) for
a workaround you can implement on local systems.
:::

You can define the domain *(and subdomain)* structure using the `WS_PROXY_DOMAIN`
environment variable:

```sh{2}
docker run \
  -e WS_PROXY_DOMAIN=ws.dev \
  ghcr.io/kloudkit/workspace:latest
```

In the configuration above, if your *workspace* is hosted at `ws.dev` and you run the
`pyserver` command *(which launches a file index server on port `8000`)*, you can access
the server at `8000.ws.dev`.

## Local DNS

If you're unable to modify a DNS server, you can manually define *hostname-to-IP* mappings
on your local machine using the `/etc/hosts` for Linux or
`C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows.
This method is useful for testing or development environments.

::: warning
This configuration only affects your local machine and does not impact external DNS
servers.
âš  Avoid using this method in production environments.
:::

To map a domain name to your local machine *(IP: 127.0.0.1)*:

1. Open `/etc/hosts` for editing.
2. Add a new entry at the end of the file. For example:

   ```plaintext
   127.0.0.1    ws.test
   ```

   Replace `ws.test` with your desired domain name.
3. Verify the configuration by running `ping ws.test` in the terminal.
   The output should show the IP `127.0.0.1`.

::: tip
Avoid using TLDs like `.dev` or `.new` as they require a *SSL* certificate.
:::

A few important notes when using this workaround:

- `/etc/hosts` does not support wildcard records *(i.e., `*.ws.test`)*.
  You must manually repeat the process for each port you intend to expose.
- This method will only work if your *workspace* is published on port `80`.
